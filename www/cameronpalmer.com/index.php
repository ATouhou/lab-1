<p>Hi. My name is Cameron Palmer and I am a graduate student at University of North Texas and my Lab is <a href="csrl.unt.edu">CSRL</a>.
This site is dedicated to my interests and documenting my work. For documents and 
assignments checkout the Wiki section.</p>
<p>As a point of explanation regarding the name of this website, I am not a 
Bitter Buffalo. The Bitter Buffalo is a specific reference to a song called
Heart Cooks Brain by Modest Mouse. Furthermore, I think the The Bitter Buffalo
would make a good name for a pub. So if you would like to use the name for a pub
please make checks payable to Cameron Palmer. As a side note the image of the
buffalo (american bison) that I used comes from the back of the american five
cent piece re-issue, which happens to look strikingly similar to the Modest Mouse concert t-shirt that was out for this album (Lonesome Crowded West).</p>
<p>I am currently working on a project to provide a better search solution for
the UNT course schedules and catalog. Come along and see the progress of 
<a href="http://unt.cameronpalmer.com">UNT Course Search</a>. At this moment the 'to text' version works and retains the original formatting.</p>
