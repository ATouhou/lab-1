Most cats do not approach humans recklessly.  The possibility of concealed
weapons, clods and sticks, tends to make them reserved.  Homeless cats in

diplomatic feelers put out, before establishing a state of truce.

I'm used to dogs.  When you leave them in the morning they stick their
nose in the door crack and stand there like a portrait until you turn
the key eight hours later.  A cat would never put up with that kind

do it on bare earth or on a carpet.  People don't know this. -- Colette

On A Cat Aging

He blinks upon the hearth-rug
And yawns in deep content,
Accepting all the comforts
That Providence has sent.

Louder he purrs and louder,
In one glad hymn of praise
For all the nights adventures,
For quiet, restful days.

Life will go on forever,
With all that cat can wish,
Warmth, and the glad procession
Of fish and milk and fish.

Only the thought disturbs him --
He's noticed once or twice,
That times are somehow breeding
A nimbler race of mice.

-- Sir Alexander Gray

Verses on a Cat

1 - A cat in distress,
  Nothing more, nor less;
Good folks, I must faithfully tell ye,
  As I am a sinner,
  It waits for some dinner
To stuff out its own little belly.

2 - You would not easily guess
  All the modes of distress
Which torture the tenants of earth;
  And the various evils,
  Which like so many devils,
Attend the poor souls from their birth.

3 - Some a living require,
  And others desire
An old fellow out of the way;
  And which is the best
  I leave to be guessed,
For I cannot pretend to say.

4 - One wants society,
  Another variety,
Others a tranquil life,
  Some want food.
  Others, as good,
Only want a wife.

5 - But this poor little cat
  Only wanted a rat,
To stuff out its own little maw;
  And it were as good
  Some people had such good,
To make them hold their jaw.

-- Percy Bysshe Shelley

A Cat's Christmas

'Twas the night before Christmas
and all through the house
Not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse.

'Cuz the cat had pounched on him
and tore him apart--
Ate his mousey intestines
and chewed up his heart.

Kitty thought he heard sleighbells,
which made him take pause--
He stopped daintily licking
the blood from his claws.

"Must be Santa," thought Kitty
(that quite clever cat)
'Cuz nobody else climbs down
the chimney like that.

Indeed it was ol' Santa,
so jolly and fat
With a huge load of presents
and all for the cat!

"Wow, the best Christmas ever!"
Kitty thought with a purr,
Then he coughed up a hairball,
and shed some more fur.
