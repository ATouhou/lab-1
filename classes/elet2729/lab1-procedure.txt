Procedure
1) Generate the circuit using Altera MAX+PLUS software as indicated in the manual.
2) Save and Check for Basic Errors. If everything is OK, check for the errors.
3) Print the Design and verify it against the lab manual.
4) Simulate the design. The waveform shows when the LED should turn on and off.
5) Program the PLD.
6) Print the report. The report has a pin diagram that will help you connect the LED.
7) Connect the wires according to the connection diagram.
8) Test the output based upon the waveform diagram.
