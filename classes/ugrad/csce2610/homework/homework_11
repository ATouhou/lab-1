In a Single-cycle design the performance will not change.
In a Multi-cycle design the length of the average instruction becomes
547ps. Down from the 600ps. So the multi-cycle design performs better.

lw - which is the longest instruction
if the first instruction 2-cycle stall, 2nd 1-cycle stall, 3rd forward.
R-type would be forward in all steps.
