The stages of gcc are:

Preprocessor - cpp
Covert to assembly - cc1
Create an object file - as
Make an executable - collect2/ld

In order: cpp -> cc1 -> as -> ld

To discover this behavior you can use the man page, or you can use strace.

You can also generate the various steps using the following commands:
gcc -E Invoke the preprocessor but don't generate assembly
gcc -S Generate the assembly code but don't proceed to object code
gcc -c Generate the object file but don't link
gcc performs all of these steps plus links the file

gcc -v Shows the indvidual steps involved as gcc is compiling.
