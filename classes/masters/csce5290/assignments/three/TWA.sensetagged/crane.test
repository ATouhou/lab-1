In 1984, there were 41; two years ago, 31. Last year 23 arrived. Only 13 reached Iran. The Siberian  <head>crane</head>  stands four and a half feet tall, its brilliant white plumage offset by a blood-red beak, face and legs. Jet-black wing quills are visible in flight. Like most birdwatchers, I have only seen them in pictures -invariably in supremely elegant poses, their long, thin beaks delicately probing the water for weeds. Unlike most birdwatchers, I am lucky enough to live less than four hours' drive from their regular winter home  a wildfowl marsh constructed by one of the Maharajahs of Bharatpur. I was there recently, talking to Dr Lalitha Vijayam about her research on the Siberian crane's problems and about my chances of seeing one before the Ob river race becomes extinct.

Up until eleven o'clock everything went pretty well, When just as you start thinking to yourself that's the last one for a while, lo and behold another wagon turns up. It was quite pleasant to get a radio call at 1115 hours to say stop doing the container wagons, we're starting the Arakan.' This job consisted of picking up thirty-six containers from the jetty Where they were being unloaded from HMAV Arakan  (one of the two Army Landing Craft Logistic) and moving them to the container park. Quite a job to keep up with the  <head>crane</head> .

Waterloo Bridge, so named because it was built in the year of the battle (1815), is one of the oldest of the iron bridges of considerable size. It was built by Telford ( q.v. ) to span the River Conwy at the southern edge of the town, as part of his work on the Holyhead road, and is an extravagant example of ironwork, cast by William Hazledine at his Plas Kynaston foundries, where the ironwork was also cast for the aqueduct at Pont Cysyllte ( q.v. ).

Adjacent is an installation of Ingersoll air compressors supplying pneumatic power for pneumatic tools, sand blast for cleaning castings, fettling tools and the moulding machines in the foundry. The smithy (No. l9) is a very fine building, 350ft long and 90ft wide, built when the Locomotive Works were at Wolverton. At the east end, the springmakers work, and the machines required by them are installed in this part, together with an electric welding machine and various bolt and nut machines; boiler-makers work on the south and west sides, and the forging presses are also laid down here while the north side is mainly occupied by drop hammers. There are no less than 70 fires, including three  <head>crane</head>  fires for very heavy work, in daily use, and in addition, 15 oil furnaces are required for the drop hammers, forging presses, etc.

No official go-ahead from the national safety authorities has yet been given. But French nuclear experts are convinced that the reference accident (a core melt-down in which the molten fuel reacts with the sodium coolant) is so improbable that the secondary containment dome can be done away with. In light-water reactors (including PWRs) the concrete shell of the reactor building needs to withstand a pressure of five bars, whereas a fast breeder has to cope with a mere 40 millibars, according to an Electricite de France engineer. One advantage of a rectangular reactor building will be a much simpler overhead  <head>crane</head> . The revolving crane in Super-Phenix is still not working properly.

I can  be sure that real teachers would have avoided a number of APU's blunders. They would not allow battery as a correct name for the symbol in Figure 1. They would allow, however, a lamp as a correct name for the symbol in Figure 2. A real teacher is unlikely to use an instruction like this, for 11-year-olds: Find three ways in which you can tell from the drawings (of spider and  <head>crane</head>  fly) that they are the same as each other and three ways in which they are different.

And Richard Parks, an engineer with the Bechtel Corporation, which built the plant and is the prime contractor for the clean-up, claimed that the operation is disorganised and at times irresponsible. There is a serious lack of coordination between Bechtel, GPU, the subcontractor and the federal agencies involved here. Bechtel has since suspended Parks. One point of contention is GPU's plan to use a  <head>crane</head>  inside the reactor building to lift the 170 tonne steel top off the reactor and then lift out the 40 000 uranium fuel elements in the  stricken  reactor. Parks and Gischel say that the crane may have been damaged in the original accident. GPU and Bechtel counter that tests have shown no sign of damage to the crane, and that all procedures were safe.

Use the map to get up to the ladder on the other side and climb out onto the platform, pick up a crate and kill the workman, now kill the green blob and complete the level by reaching the flag. LEVEL 5 Probably the biggest level in the game but it's not too hard. From the start, pick up a crate and kill the policeman, continue right, dodging the dog on the way, climb the ladder to where the mugger prowls, dodge him and grab the ? (50 points) and the records, climb upwards, collecting records on the way, kill the workman with the crate and thus gain access to the roof of the building, avoid climbing the  <head>crane</head>  (there's nothing of interest there), climb up the ladder and kill the policeman, run right and jump off the edge to the end of the building.

It is for this reason whales and hippopotami actually increase their mass to prevent floating. There is also evidence, as we have mentioned before and shall see in the next chapter, of the extensive use of air sacs in sauropods as cooling devices and for reducing mass. Many sauropods, in spite of their ever-growing height spurred on by the need to reach the foliage of trees growing ever higher, had hollowed out, weight-saving  vertebrae and a pelvic girdle described by one writer as being like a suspension bridge, with the massive erect hind legs acting as the down-pillar, and the long torso and rigid tail acting as the cross-span. Indeed, the six-metre long sauropod neck has been likened to a living  <head>crane</head>  for lifting the head to feed, with up to fifteen vertebrae possessing unique extra articulations in the neck to combine strength with agility.

When the  North  American  Indians gave fresh cranberries as a gift to the Pilgrim families, it's unlikely that they were aware of the berries' peculiar talent  they can bounce! Today, it is this factor which determines whether they will be sold as fresh fruit or processed into juice or sauce. During the selection process berries are bounced along shaking conveyor belts which are crossed with four inch high wooden barriers  they must be fresh and firm enough to bounce over the boards. A dollop of cranberry sauce has been the traditional accompaniment to turkey since the Pilgrim Fathers ate what they called  <head>crane</head>  berries (the flowers resemble cranes)  probably in the form of a sauce  with turkey at the Thanksgiving feast, celebrating their survival of the first winter spent in America.

Both The Daleks and The Sensorites featured very elaborate backdrops, all of which Cusick had first to draft out as large, highly detailed colour illustrations long before the day when the Scenic Artist would come in to paint them up. Neither could these illustrations just be rough approximations of the finished articles. The perspectives, the horizon points, the viewing angles all had to be worked out beforehand so that camera shots would enable the backdrops to appear as natural continuations of the sets, instead of suddenly sloping up or downhill. If a  <head>crane</head>  camera was to be used, for instance, it would be no use designing a backdrop with a vanishing point relevant to one of its pedestal mounted brethren. The near, right-hand end-window of the caravan is partially blinded by a crude leaded-light depicting a pink figure with purple beard swimming into the mouth of a big purple fish. Rising from the roof of the caravan is an eight-foot Dexion cross guyed by a triple wire  hawser. Both upright and cross-member are strung with orange light bulbs. Beyond the caravan, various sheds, a yellow crane and mountains of wrecked vehicles.

One advantage is that if for any reason the storage system becomes unused the building may be used for other purposes. The racking is constructed on a back-to-back principle up to 20 metres high with intervening gangways as little as 1.5 metres wide. Typical rack lengths are between 100 and 200 metres and number of aisles can vary from as little as 2 to as many as 30. In some systems one  <head>crane</head>  serves more than one aisle and in this case is moved from aisle to aisle by an automatic transfer system. Pallets may be placed away either under manual or automatic control according to the control system chosen. In the case of manual systems one person per crane is usually all that is required to operate that part of the system with in-feed fork- lift trucks being restricted to an access area at the front of the warehouse. Automatic systems usually have an in-feed/out-feed conveyor and sufficient forklift trucks to feed the system  again in each case they are not operating within the crane and storage area. A firm principle with this kind of automatic system is restriction of access to anyone other than maintenance and inventory control personnel, in which case a strict control is kept upon crane operation.

Overall these species are darker, smaller and hairier than temperate counterparts. Darkness and hairiness, especially noticeable in butterflies of the genera Boloria  and Colias , are taken to be adaptations for absorbing and retaining heat during basking. Smallness facilitates rapid warming to working temperatures, though it may also be a symptom of food sparsity; compactness, including relative shortness of limbs and wings, helps to conserve heat and moisture. Wings are short or absent in several arctic species of stone flies,  <head>crane</head>  flies, midges and moths; females are especially likely to have reduced wings and  to avoid flying.
