5.29)
a) RegWrite = 0
All R-Format Insructions and lw will be broken. 

b) MemRead = 0
No instruction will work correctly since instructions can't be read from memory.

c) MemWrite = 0
Store Word (sw) will fail to write into memory, register only functions should be fine.

d) IRWrite = 0
No instruction will work correctly since the IR register is broken.

e) PCWrite = 0
Jump instruction will fail.

f) PCWriteCond = 0
Branch instructions will fail.

5.32)
See Attached FSM.
It will take four cycles

5.35)
You are going to need another mux to switch between the two registers and a control
signal to toggle it. This will also force you to break up the state diagram so you
read the two registers, one and then the other.

5.36)
M1 is the fastest.
Depending on the instruction mix you could obtain different results. You could contrive
a program that did something ridiculous to make machine 3 faster, but not by much. The
problem you encounter is the performance penalty you pay to reduce the CPI.
