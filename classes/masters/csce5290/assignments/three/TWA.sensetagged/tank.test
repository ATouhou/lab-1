Creating a vortex For waste collection in my workshop I use a Hoover Wet/Dry Powervac Super, fitted with a pleated paper drum filter and connected to my tools and machines with flexible hoses. I also use the vac in the garden, collecting leaves, grass and hedge clippings. But by using an auxiliary collecting  <head>tank</head>  I am able to increase the capacity by more than eight time, thereby avoiding having the empty the vac so frequently. I acquired a 1301 plastic tank (the kind with a removable lid which is retained in position with a ring clamp) and installed inlet and outlet hose sockets in the sides close to the top at diagonally opposite points. The hose sockets were the genuine parts supplied with the Powervac. These required a little modification to get a better fit around the radius of the tank, sealing with a glue gun. If ordinary drainage fittings are used it is vital that the inner parts of both inlet and outlet are passed through a 90 elbow to create a vortex. The tank's lid is so good that the suction is enough to seal it, with the ring clamp.

The brewery has only horizontal tanks, in which the fermenting wort is a mere 2.8 metres high. People in Bavaria say it is crazy not  to  have tall cylindro-conicals in a wholly ultra-modern brewery, says Brombach, but I think that kind of vessel sets up a convection that makes for dirty beer.

The filtered beer is  <head>tank</head>  conditioned, but the greater part of output has a secondary fermentation in the bottle.

I overcame the problem by making the shelves in the cupboard easily removable. Using 3 and 1/2; 3/4;in wooden slats resting on battens, I made spacers from the same wood, and glued these to the battens. There's no need to nail the shelves down, as they can't move sideways because of the spacers. Except for the few slats supporting the tank, all the shelves in the cupboard can be removed in a moment, making access really easy.

By DAVID KEYS The 50th anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War has largely been an armchair affair, commemorated in newspapers and magazines, on the radio and television. However, outside your sitting room thousands of wartime military installations still survive as historically important reminders of Britain's epic struggle. Fighter and Bomber Command airfields, anti  <head>tank</head>  defences, gun emplacements, prisoner of war camps  and some 6,000 pillboxes still form part of the landscape in many areas of the country. In the heart of London's Whitehall visitors can explore the warren of cramped underground rooms and passageways which served as the nerve centre of Britain's war effort. Known as the Cabinet War Rooms, the complex has only been open to the public since 1983. Inside, one can still see the Map Room, where Churchill used to study the progress of the war, the Cabinet Room where many of the Second World War's most important decisions were made, and Churchill's personal accommodation from which he made several of his wartime broadcasts. In the space of 12 months the War Office built 25,000 pillboxes  almost a quarter of which still survive  and erected hundreds of miles of concrete anti-tank defences. On windswept lonely Chesil Beach  that great ten mile long pile of pebbles which stretches westwards along the Dorset coast from Portland  one can still explore the pillboxes and anti-tank defences which were built in 1940 to resist the threat of invasion. And later in the war, in 1943, it was this imposing natural wall of shingle which was used by the famous Dambusters as a practice target before their attack on the Mohne and Eder dams in Germany. Fifty miles inland, the remains of the wartime government's fall-back line of defence still survives, mostly along the line of the Kennett-Avon canal. Between Bradford-on-Avon and Reading are some 200 pillboxes built in 1940 to house mobile two pound anti-tank guns and machine guns in the event of invasion. The recesses in the pillbox floors where the guns would have fitted are still there today. The various different types of pillbox can be seen from the canal towpath. Larger scale gun emplacements, however, are much rarer. The only surviving group of such installations can be explored at Curry Mallet near Taunton, Somerset, where three large gun emplacements with three-foot-thick concrete walls were built to house six-pounder anti-tank guns with a range of half a mile.

Soviet threat to 3bn pounds anti- <head>tank</head>  missile projects By MARK URBAN, Defence Correspondent BRITAIN'S plans for a new generation of anti-tank weapons, involving projects costing more than 3bn, could be thrown into turmoil after the discovery of new armour on Soviet tanks. Ministry of Defence sources say that two of the Army's three new anti-tank missiles will be ineffective against the frontal armour of new Soviet tanks. Warsaw Pact tanks have been fitted in recent years with additional armour, designed to explode when hit by an anti-tank missile, so neutralising its effect. This is called reactive armour. The Army's new anti-tank weapons are being designed with tandem warheads; the first explodes reactive armour and the second penetrates the shell of the tank. Now it has emerged that Soviet tanks are being fitted with two or three layers of the reactive armour, which probably renders the tandem warhead ineffective. Les Aspin, a member of the US Congress and chairman of the powerful Armed Services Committee, said he had a nasty surprise when he saw Soviet tanks fitted with the multi-layer reactive armour during a visit to the Ukraine in August. In the latest Jane's Defence Weekly, he says this discovery can't be anything but bad news to forces planning to defend against these tanks with current anti-tank weapons. The Army is taking delivery of LAW-80, a short range anti-tank weapon costing 400m. But it cannot penetrate the frontal armour of new Soviet tanks, MoD sources say. Britain is collaborating with France and West Germany, in a project called Trigat, to develop medium and long range anti-tank missiles. The cost to Britain is 780m and 1.85bn respectively. Medium range Trigat has been designed with a tandem warhead and is due to enter service in the mid-1990s. It will be ineffective against the multi-layer reactive armour, experts say. Long range Trigat is being designed to make a diving attack on the roof of a tank, where the armour is normally at its weakest. Explosive reactive armour, which is fitted in box-shaped panels, has been fixed to the turret roof of modern Soviet tanks. The long range weapon is not due to enter service until the late 1990s and may be delayed while scientists attempt to modify the warhead to defeat the multi-layered Soviet armour. Further delays could have a serious effects on Army plans to introduce a fleet of gunship anti-tank helicopters, for which the long range Trigat is intended to be the primary weapon. The MoD may be forced to incur further costs by buying another anti-tank missile as an interim solution until the long range Trigat is ready. Some officers familiar with the medium range Trigat project are sceptical that it can be modified to defeat the new armour. They believe Britain should pull out of the project and find another weapon to fill the same role. Reactive armour has hardly any effect on the solid, armour-piercing rounds fired from tank guns. The new development may strengthen, therefore, the case of those who back the early replacement of the Army's Chieftain tank fleet.

However, staying for a moment with hi-jacking, here we have a specialised form of the Breakthrough Phenomenon, which until the antidote is produced or produces itself, has quite startling pyrotechnic results, but collapses again as the antidote is devised.

The 24-valve engine is appreciably noisier that its 12-valve predecessor and although it invariably sounds good, its insistence can be a little wearing. Our overall consumption of 26.6mpg is a fine result given the zest with which the 325i performs and its relatively short intermediate gearing, though the best return of 27.9mpg suggests that some feather-footed tactics aren't as effective as some might expect.

Shot towers were devised in the eighteenth century for the casting of lead shot. Molten lead was mixed with arsenic and poured through a sort of outsize colander from a great height into a  <head>tank</head>  of water.
