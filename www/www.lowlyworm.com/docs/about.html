About
<hr width=70% size=1></div> 
<p>Originally I registered this address, lowlyworm.com, when I worked for Bank of the Northern Hemisphere. We needed a domain name for testing and for security reasons wanted a name that wasn't associated with the Bank. Since superstardestroyerexecutor.com was too long, I settled on lowlyworm. Lowlyworm as you may know is a character by Richard Scarry. Richard Scarry has written a number of children's books. If you have never seen one of these books, look more carefully when you visit the doctor's office. It is probably kicking it next to Highlights and Ranger Rick back issues.</p>

<p>When I left the Bank the name came with me. At this point I've been using this domain name for so long I don't have the heart to get rid of it. And besides I rather like it.</p>
