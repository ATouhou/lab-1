<p>Hi. My name is Cameron Palmer and I am a student at University of North Texas.
This site is dedicated to my interests and documenting my work. For documents and 
assignments checkout the Wiki section.</p>
<p>As a point of explanation regarding the name of this website, I am not a 
Bitter Buffalo. The Bitter Buffalo is a specific reference to a song called
Heart Cooks Brain by Modest Mouse. Furthermore, I think the The Bitter Buffalo
would make a good name for a pub. So if you would like to use the name for a pub
please make checks payable to Cameron Palmer. As a side note the image of the
buffalo (american bison) that I used comes from the back of the american five
cent piece re-issue, which happens to look strikingly similar to the Modest Mouse
concert t-shirt that was out for this album (Lonesome Crowded West). 
Unfortunately my favorite t-shirt, met with an untimely demise when changing the 
lead-acid car battery. So if you know where I can get a genuine, not a cheap 
knock-off from ebay, medium sized, brown Modest Mouse bitter buffalo t-shirt 
please contact me. In the mean time I only have this logo to remind me of that 
shirt.</p>
<p>I am currently working on a project to provide a better search solution for
the UNT course schedules and catalog. Come along and see the progress of
