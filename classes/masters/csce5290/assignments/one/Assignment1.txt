Language models for language identification

Language identification is the problem of taking a text in an unknown language 
and determine what language is written in. N-grams models are very effective 
solutions for this problem.

For training, use the English, French, and Italian texts made available from 
the class webpage. For test, use the file LangId.test provided on the class 
webpage. For each of the following problems, the output of your program has 
to contain a list of [line_id] [language] pairs, starting with line 1. For 
instance,
   1 English
   2 Italian
   ...
  

1 [20 points]. 
Implement a letter bigram model, which learns letter bigram probabilities 
from the training data. A separate bigram model has to be learned for each 
language. 
Apply the models to determine the most likely language for each sentence in 
the test file (that is, determine the probability associated with each sentence
in the test file, using each of the three language models). 
Compare your output file with the solution file (LangId.sol). How many times 
your program was correct?
  
Save the program as letterLangId.pl 
Save the output as letterLangId.out


2 [25 points].  
Implement a word bigram model, which learns word bigram probabilities from 
the training data. Again, a separate model will be learned for each language. 
Use add-one smoothing to avoid zero-counts in the data. Apply the models to 
determine the language for each sentence in the test file.  
Compare your output file with the solution file (LangId.sol). How many times 
your program was correct?
  
Save the program as wordLangId.pl 
Save the output as wordLangId.out


3 [5290 only; 15 points]. 
Same as 2, but replace the add-one smoothing with Good-Turing smoothing.
Save the program as wordLangId2.pl
Save the output as wordLangId2.out

Submission instructions:
   - write a README file including a detailed note about the 
   functionality of each of the programs, and complete instructions 
   on how to run them; the README file should also include answers to 
   all the questions above.
   - make sure you include your name in each program and in the README file.
   - make sure all your programs run correctly on the CSP machines.
   - submit your assignment by the due date using the 'project' program.
     class code is 5290s001, project HW1.
