\section*{Single-dimension software pipelining for multidimensional loops}

Software pipelining has been a technique for scheduling instructions for inner-most loops for some time. This paper extends the software pipelining techniques to the most profitable loop-level, not just the inner-most loop.

The authors implement their algorithm on the IA-64 architecture which supports Rotating Registers and Predicates. They used the SPEC2000 floating point benchmarks and found their technique yieleded some improvement.

It seems that this is good work, but still has a way to go. They haven't yet explored many of the issues that will be important for wide-spread adoption of this technique. Specifically, how this technique will impact other loop transformations.
