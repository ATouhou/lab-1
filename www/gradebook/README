User Instructions
I hope the majority of the application is self explanatory. The main issue you will
encounter in an empty system is the need to create a Term, Course, Categories, and Assignments.
You will also need to create and add students to classes.

Statement of Limitations, Enhancements, Problems
The program could use polish. Much of the backend functionality for a bigger
gradebook system is in place. The biggest problem I had was rendering the main
gradebook page. On the main gradebook page it is hard to create the gradebook on
the fly and then render the table with appropriate layout. My thought is that
the gradebook table needs to be reimplemented as a class, and the gradebook queries
to the database need to be thought about more. I did also develop code to perform
user login and logout which is implemented seperately from this project but upon
completion should be easy to add.

Journal
I finished everything but the main gradebook page shortly after the SRD and Design
document were turned in. Due to other class projects I was unable to to pick this
up again until dead week.
