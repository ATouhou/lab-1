            <h2>TeleBeamer Model A Technology</h2>
         </div>
         <div id="textpage">
            <p>The TeleBeamer Model A can transport any non-living matter
            anywhere on the planet, instantly.  It uses a new technology 
            developed by Enterprise Technologies (ET). This technology is called
            photon Projection.</p>
            
            <h2>Photon projection</h2>
            <p>Photon projection uses super-accelerated light particles 
            (photons) to disassemble an object’s atoms. It then beams those 
            atoms to another location and reassembles them in exactly the same
            condition as before the process.</p>
            <p>The technology that makes this possible was developed by ET over 
            a period of 15 years and is safe and reliable.  The secret to 
            successful photon projection is ET’s proprietary supercomputer 
            technology, ETNIAC.</p>
            <h2>ETNIAC</h2>
            <p>ETNIAC, short for Enterprise Technical Network Information
            Assembly Calculator, is the most powerful supercomputer in the 
            world.  It can make 14 billion calculations a second.  It can sort
            the atoms of an object and send them to any target on the planet. 
            It is so intelligent it can calculate any and all variables for any
            possibilities.   This makes every TeleBeamer shipment arrive in 
            perfect condition, every time.  It calculates all forms of 
            atmospheric interference instantly; making every shipment perfect.</p>
            <p>It locates any precise target of your choosing using, the
            Enterprise Technologies Positioning Satellite (ETPS).</p>
            <h2>ETPS</h2>
            <p>The ETPS is a series of 5,000 global positioning satellites. The 
            large number of satellites is for redundancy. Meaning that if 4,999
            satellites malfunctioned, your delivery would still get were it’s
            supposed to be safely and instantly. If all the satellites 
            malfunctioned the TeleBeamer model A automatically restores the 
            delivery to the point of origin safely. There is no possibility of 
            lost or damaged materials. <a href="service.html">That’s the ET Guarantee.</a></p>
