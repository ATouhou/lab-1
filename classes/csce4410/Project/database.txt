How I setup the MySQL database for the gradebook system:

// One time setup command
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO gradedb@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'gradedbpw' WITH GRANT OPTION;

// Create the database called gradebook
CREATE DATABASE gradebook;

// Tell mysql that you are going to edit that database you just created.
USE gradebook;

// Create the students table. Likely you will delete and recreate this a few times
// until you get it the way you want. So it is good to have this handy dandy cheat sheet.
CREATE TABLE students (voteid INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, user VARCHAR(100), vote_date DATE, vote_value BOOL);


// To insert a student into the table
INSERT INTO students VALUES (null, 'smith, john', '2006-01-01', true);

// Reporting of sorts, and sanity checking
DESCRIBE students;  // This means show what the table looks like.
SELECT * FROM students;  // This mean show all the values in the students table AKA show me the vote entries. Hello, Diebold.

// Administrative commands
DROP students;  // Deletes the students table so you can recreate it. Medium Danger.
DROP gradebook;  // Deletes the whole database. DANGER! Not what you probably want to do.
