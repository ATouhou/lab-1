5.2)
RegWrite - All R-type instructions will not work, and lw will not work. This is because
they will be unable to write the results to the registers.

ALUop0 - It will be unable to perform additions necessary for loads and stores

ALUop1 - It will be unable to perform subtractions for beq

Branch - Branch will not work

MemRead - You will not be able to load data in memory into a register

MemWrite - You will not be able to write date into memory

5.8)
See attached drawing.

5.11) 
l_inc instruction truth values
We will need a new control line, and the additional circuity to increment the address
index by 4.

RegDst = 0
ALUSrc = 1
MemtoReg = 1
RegWrite = 1
MemRead = 1
MemWrite = 0
Branch = 0
ALUOp1 = 0
ALUOp2 = 0
Write2 = 1
