I received the materials that you sent. In 1977 another letter came, then a long silence until 1981, then a letter in 1984.

Its narrator and chief human presence is by no means straightforwardly a victim, and the difference between oppressor and oppressed can be hard to identify. The novel is narrated by a Moslem of Indian origin, whose family has been settled on the east coast of Africa, as traders. Salim leaves them, takes off on the first of a series of flights, and treks to the interior, to a country which appears to be compounded of the Congo and of Uganda, in order to earn a living from a store which he has acquired from a man whose daughter he is expected to marry one day. Reading Salim's  <head>palm</head> , the man points out that he is faithful.

Some of the most fascinating demi-caractre  ballets are those where the choreographer has sought inspiration from oriental dance. This can be fairly easy to achieve because a brief study of ancient Egyptian friezes shows exactly how to adapt the movements depicted to the turned-out legs of classical dance. Petipa attempted this in The Daughter of Pharaoh . This type of choreography was taken up by later music-hall acts whose very eccentric soft shoe, sand dances before a background of pyramids and  <head>palm</head>  trees aroused much laughter.

Although innovation in particular cases had fostered very high population densities, it was the absence of population growth resulting from both the slave trade and the incidence of disease that provided little general incentive to intensify systems which were an adequate response to the difficulties of the environment.

Their primary emphasis was on the development of large-scale commercial agriculture  either through large, corporate-owned estates (as with oil  <head>palm</head>  in Zaire, coffee, and bananas in Cameroun, and cotton in Sudan), through individual settlers (as in Kenya, Zimbabwe and Zambia), or through both (as in Tanzania and Cameroun).
