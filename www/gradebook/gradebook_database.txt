How I setup the MySQL database for the gradebook system:

// One time setup command
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO gradedb@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'gradedbpw' WITH GRANT OPTION;

// Create the database called stc
CREATE DATABASE gradebook;

// Tell mysql that you are going to edit that database you just created.
USE gradebook;

// To create a student table.
CREATE TABLE student (student_key INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, empl_id INT(), first_name VARCHAR(25), last_name VARCHAR(25), email VARCHAR(50), phone VARCHAR(), euid VARCHAR(), photo MEDIUMBLOB(), comments TEXT(), is_active TINYINT());
// Create the basic admin called 'root' password 'test'
INSERT INTO student (student_key,empl_id,first_name,last_name,email,phone,euid,comments,is_active) VALUES (null,'10436511','Cameron','Palmer','cameron.palmer@gmail.com','9724952097','clp0147',null,'1');

// Create the votes table. Likely you will delete and recreate this a few times
// until you get it the way you want. So it is good to have this handy dandy cheat sheet.
CREATE TABLE votes (voteid INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, user VARCHAR(100), vote_date DATE, vote_value BOOL);

// To insert a vote into the table

// Reporting of sorts, and sanity checking
DESCRIBE votes;  // This means show what the table looks like.
SELECT * FROM votes;  // This mean show all the values in the votes table AKA show me the vote entries. Hello, Diebold.

// Administrative commands
DROP votes;  // Deletes the votes table so you can recreate it. Medium Danger.

DROP stc;  // Deletes the whole stc database. DANGER! Not what you probably want to do.
