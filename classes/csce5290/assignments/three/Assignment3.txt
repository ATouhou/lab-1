Word sense disambiguation
Issued: 10/25/07  Due: 11/16/07 
Total points: 80


1. [60 points] 

Implement a Naive Bayes word sense disambiguation algorithm, using
features consisting of words in a window around the word being 
disambiguated. 

Evaluate your algorithm using the data provided on the class webpage
for six ambiguous words: bass, crane, motion, palm, plant, and tank. 
For the evaluation, you should use 5-way cross validation:  train on 
4/5 of the data and test on 1/5, selecting each 1/5 of the data in turn, 
and then averaging the results.  Report an accuracy for each word, 
a baseline (based on selecting the most likely prior), and an overall 
accuracy.


2. [5290 only: 20 points]

Supplement the set of features using keywords in context. How are the 
new features affecting the disambiguation performance? Report the new
accuracy for each word, as well as overall accuracy.
