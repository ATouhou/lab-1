# Rules to Conway's Game of Life
# Survivals - Every counter with two or three neighbors survives for the next 
# generation.
#
# Deaths - Every counter with four or more neighbors dies from overpopulation. 
# Every counter with one neighbor or none dies from isolation.
#
# Births - Each empty cell adjacent to exactly three neighbors, no more, no 
# fewer, is a birth cell. A counter is placed on it at the next move.
