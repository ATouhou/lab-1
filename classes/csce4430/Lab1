		Lab "Exercise" for 4430/5450

The objectives of this dedicated lab time are:

	. Make sure that each student has an active CSP account
          that they can access remotely.

	. Familiarize each student with the use of Makefile(s) and
          scripts to support the compilation and execution of the
          supplied GA software.

	. Allow each student to insert their own version of "new" into
          a least one class in the C++ implementation of GAs supplied.

	. Provide practice for any student nervous about C++ programming.

Instructions:

	. First, log on to a CSP of your choice.  One way to do this
          from the computers in 218 is to use putty, and specify one of
          csp01 ... csp09 as the machine to use.

	. Make a new directory within your own "domain"  (in other words
          a directory somewhere under your home directory.)

	. Copy all of the GA code to the directory you just made.  To do
          that, "move" to that directory and type:

		cp -r ~sweany/public/ProgrammingLanguages/GAExperiment .

	. Enter your copy of the GAExperiment directory that you've just
          built and type 

		make

	. Having done all of that, add, to your version of GAExperiment,
          code to override the "new" operator for at least one of the
          classes defined GAExperiment.

IF you finish early:

	. Instrument the code of GAExperiment to print out the number of
          times the different "new" operators are called.   This will
          give you and idea of where (and how?) you can save execution
          time by replacing "new."
