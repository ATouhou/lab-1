Information on GSM Phones, Java, Perl and TiVo</h1></center>

<p><h2>AT&T Wireless GPRS:</h2>
<blockquote>
The AT&T Wireless GPRS system is super easy to configure on a phone like the Nokia 7210. However the ATTWS customer support people are not very helpful. I guess they think everyone should buy a phone from AT&T. Thanks but I couldn't wait for a decent GSM phone.<br>
<li> Setting's name can be anything but I named it AWS WAP
<li> Homepage http://home
<li> Session mode is Permanent
<li> Connection security is On

<p><h2>Java IP Subnet Calculator:</h2>
<blockquote>
I'm currently working on an IP subnet calculator in Java. My plan is to have it running on all platforms and my Nokia 7210. The Nokia 7210 is Java MIDP capable so I am excited to be able to use my phone for subnetting. It will be open-source.

<p><h2>TiVo, TiVo Series 2 Hacking</h2>
<blockquote>
I think the TiVo, which is Linux based is the coolest commercial product in a long time. It is up there with the Sharp Zaurus. If you don't own a TiVo, you should. And hacking it is of course the natural next step. I would like to reverse engineer the file system if I get time and publish the spec. After all it is merely a modified MPEG stream. I really want to dump the Buffy the Vampire Slayer epispde 'Once more with feeling' to DVD. An admirable goal I think.
