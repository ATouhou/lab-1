Along this fiery path and valley, the tossing waves by which the swell of the sea is restlessly divided, lift themselves in dark, indefinite, fantastic forms, each casting a faint and ghastly shadow behind it along the illumined foam Purple and blue, the lurid shadows of the hollow breakers are cast upon the mist of night, which gathers cold and low, advancing like the shadow of death upon the guilty ship as it labours amid the lightening of the sea, its thin mast written upon the sky, in lines of blood I believe, if I were reduced to rest Turner's immortality upon any single work, I should choose this. Its daring conception, ideal in the highest sense of the word, is based on the purest truth, and wrought out with the concentrated knowledge of a life, its colour is almost perfect, not one false or morbid hue in any part or line, and so modulated that every square inch of canvas is a perfect composition; its drawing is as accurate as fearless; the ship buoyant, bending, and full of  <head>motion</head> ; its tones as true as they are wonderful; and the whole picture dedicated to the most sublime of subjects and impressions the power, majesty and deathfulness of the open, deep, illimitable sea.

I had gone too far and  experienced too much, I needed to slow down, to get back to the small things, the practical things, to measuring and cutting and fixing, and it was with relief that I noticed that daylight had begun to invade the room, I kept quite still, I held the glass firmly in my gaze, gradually the elements already worked on began to emerge, some more clearly than others, some in outline only and some only when they impeded the free flow of light through the glass, until the sun came up and was reflected back from the windows of the house opposite and I could sit and look at the glass and think back through the work and the mistakes and the few successes, and sense again with that sickening feeling in the pit of the stomach that the whole of the right hand side of the lower panel was still a mess, nothing there had been resolved, but then I drew back from that, though it kept trying to pull me back to itself, and concentrated on what was beginning to work, on the left hand areas both top and bottom and on the elegance of the frame and the joy of seeing the bare walls and the wainscoting appear through the empty areas, and as I moved round so different parts of the room appeared and the relation of the surface of the glass to what lay behind changed, precision and fluidity, precision and fluidity, he wrote, choice and chance, not choice alone and chance alone but the two together, that is why delay, not stoppage and not flow but delay, delay in glass, he wrote, as when the plane is late and you should have been gone, have already arrived perhaps, but you are still there, or the sprinter beats the gun and the whole field is called back, the race could have been over but it has not yet started.

Institutions have the pathetic megalomania of the computer whose whole vision of the world is its own programme. This extremely perceptive analysis of the institutional mind fits the police world like a glove, and recent elaborations in policing, along with its growth in the mainstream of the daily social process, supports Douglas's contention (ibid.) that an institution which is dependent upon authority can only demand more of the  same. In such ontological circumstances this allegedly public service must be singularly unsuited to objective assessment of any external demands for a reduction in its power or to encompassing any critical analysis which might cause loss of prestige. Given this premise, we should not be surprised to find the police are in the forefront of support for proposals such as the introduction of identity cards; it was not surprising to find the 1988 Superintendents' Association conference not only supporting this  <head>motion</head> , but arguing for the creation of twenty-four hour armed patrols throughout the country and making a plea for a national motorway squad.

So as the 1980s drew to a close, the sub-sectors dubbed Coal, Construction, Petroleum and Metals were all in fine shape, and their outlook for the 1990s is promising. Not that the eighties were without their problems: quite apart from the industrial recession of the early years, which affected all Railfreight's bulk traffics to some degree or other, there was the historic miners' strike of 19845, taking heavy toll of steel as well as coal carryings. Happily the coal traffic was revived to the point where pre-strike tonnages were exceeded, although the number of individual collieries served was vastly reduced. The merry-go-round system which allows loading and discharge to take place while an entire train remains in  <head>motion</head>  has continued to form the mainstay of Railfreight Coal's operations, and it is difficult to imagine a more efficient alternative.

Speedie should have brought the aggregate level after 25 minutes, but leant back as he met a lay-off by Cyrille Regis, and his shot ballooned over the bar. He is a better finisher than that, of course, and amends were duly made in the 43rd minute when he brought it to 2-0 on the night and 3-3 overall by meeting David Smith's low centre from the left with a 12-yard volley of stunning velocity. Understandably, given their numerical disadvantage, Grimsby made little headway in attack, although Alexander, at 6ft 4in, was of a nuisance value against a defence deprived by injury of Brian Kilcline's aerial authority.

Last week the first practical steps towards such a union were taken when leaders of the RPR, UDF and UDC met and agreed to form a tactical group to work out the most effective means of opposing the government. The first decision of this tactical group was not to table a motion of no confidence during the debate on the bill which sets this year's level of defence spending.

A typical  <head>motion</head>  will congratulate Her Majesty's Government on its policy, and call upon it to continue. I call this a congratulate, and call upon motion. There is the occasional congratulate, but call upon motion, but such deep dissent is rare.

GEOFFREY BOYCOTT'S credibility as a member of Yorkshire's general committee was dented further yesterday when he left the emergency meeting an hour before the end, writes Derek Hodgson. Sid Fielden, an erstwhile ally and chairman of the county's public relations sub-committee said afterwards: I find his conduct difficult to understand and impossible to explain. The meeting had been called, in advance of the general monthly gathering, to investigate Yorkshire's dismal record last season and to discuss a suggestion by the captain, Phil Carrick, that players born outside the county be recruited. A  <head>motion</head>  calling for the signing of an overseas professional was rejected unanimously; only three votes were recorded in favour, one presumably Boycott's, of signing players born outside the county.
