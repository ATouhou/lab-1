Subversion Commands

***svn ci -> Check in***
Send all changes made to files under subversion control
svn ci -m "comments related to changes"

***svn co -> Check out***
Grab something from the subversion repository for the first time.
svn co http://svn.cameronpalmer.com/lab/mss
This will download to a folder locally called mss

***svn up -> Update***
Grab changes from the server, always a good idea before starting work
From within the folder to update:
svn up
This is a recursive command and will grab all changes below the current position in
the filesystem.

***svn add -> Add***
When adding a file:
svn add filename

When adding a directory and all its contents (recursive):
svn add directory/

When adding a directory but not its contents (non-recursive):
svn add -N directory/

***svn rm -> Remove***
Deletes a file and removes it from subversion on the next check in


***svn mkdir -> Make Directory***
Creates a directory and adds it
svn mkdir directory/

***svn revert***
This special command is how you can bring back the previous version of a file
Simplest case:
svn revert filename
