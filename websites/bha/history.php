<p>Bruce Hall opened in 1948 as an all women's dorm, because of this there were
no doors on the rooms just curtains. A housing shortage in that year forced students
to move in before Bruce was even finished. In the 1970s Bruce became co'ed. Ever
since then the hall has earned a reputation as the dorm for the creative mind. Because
of this Bruce is host to many unique events.</p>
<p>In 1988 Bruce held its first Bruce Jam concert, an event where local bands could
play and show their talent. This originally was a one-time deal but because of its
popularity Bruce Jam was continued every year.</p>
<p>Throughout the years Bruce has undergone many renovations to make it the Bruce 
it is today. The first major renovation was in 1983, the roof was replaced, smoke
detectors add, and the wood cornices were repaired. In 1984 the caferteria was
brought up to date and in 1991-1992 the entire building was rewired. Today Bruce stands
as the creative dorm and the heart of UNT.</p>
