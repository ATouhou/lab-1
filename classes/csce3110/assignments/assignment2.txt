Problem 8) Fibonacci iterative and recursive versions
I provide two shell scripts that automatically call the program with the
required values. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64

Fibonacci1.cpp Iterative version:
Fibonacci number 1 is 1 in 0 seconds.
Fibonacci number 2 is 1 in 0 seconds.
Fibonacci number 4 is 3 in 0 seconds.
Fibonacci number 8 is 21 in 0 seconds.
Fibonacci number 16 is 987 in 0 seconds.
Fibonacci number 32 is 2178309 in 0 seconds.
Fibonacci number 64 is 1640636603 in 0 seconds.

Fibonacci2.cpp Recursive version:
Fibonacci number 1 is 1 in 0 seconds.
Fibonacci number 2 is 1 in 0 seconds.
Fibonacci number 4 is 3 in 0 seconds.
Fibonacci number 8 is 21 in 0 seconds.
Fibonacci number 16 is 987 in 0 seconds.
Fibonacci number 32 is 2178309 in 0.06 seconds.
Fibonacci number 64 failed to finish.

Since each call to the recursive function will require 2^n the calls, the 
program will not complete when given 64 as an input.
