Until the mid- and late 1970s, there were simply no rules whereby groupings of parents could obtain a state-financed, multi-denominational school, as the only channels of communication in these matters were those between the Department of Education and the relevant diocesan department or other church board. For example, a new housing estate would be built, the diocese would be informed of the development at the planning stage, and the diocesan office would put in for a school, or an extension for an existing school. The arrangement had been unchanged since the early years of the state and had become entirely natural. Similarly for the protestant community: the school  <head>plant</head>  is owned by the church, or appropriate church body.

I've often wondered about the origin of Evan's encyclopaedic knowledge on this topic. It is an area of study with a strong academic bias, the foundations of which were nonetheless in local exploration.

THE incineration of PCBs requires a furnace which will hold the material at 1,100C for at least two seconds, in the presence of plenty of oxygen. Companies wishing to enter the waste disposal business at this level must demonstrate to the local Waste Disposal Authority (usually a county council, but in some cities and in Wales a more local authority) that they can meet various criteria, although the authority may be over-ruled on appeal to the Secretary of State for the Environment. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution is now the custodian of national standards on emissions from such plants, of which Britain currently has three. Rechem can take solid and liquid wastes contaminated with PCBs at its  <head>plant</head>  at Pontypool (30,000 tonnes a year), and liquid wastes (20,000 tonnes a year) at its plant at Fawley, near Southampton. Cleanaway can take liquid PCBs at its Ellesmere Port establishment, where it is building another plant which will take capacity there to 48,000 tonnes annually. Ocean Environmental Management has applied for a 30,000-tonne plant at Seal Sands, Teesside, and is appealing against the local authority's refusal to allow it. Leigh Environmental wants to build an incinerator plant near Doncaster, but also faces local authority opposition, and International Technology Corporation has submitted a joint application with Northumbrian Water for incinerators at Teesside and Tyneside for the incineration of sewage sludge and organic wastes, with a capacity of 43,000 tonnes each.

MANY OF the 60-odd species of slipper orchid, the best known and most popular orchid in the West, could be extinct within 10 years without tough measures to halt the vast illegal trade in wild varieties. The Dutch government is so concerned that at next week's 103-nation conference in Lausanne of the Convention on Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) it will call for a total ban on trade in the plants. It says the present system, which allows controlled international trade, has failed to prevent heavy illegal smuggling of wild Paphiopedilum (slipper) orchids.

There are more than 40 nuclear reactors and 22,000km of gas pipeline passing through built-up areas. The Siberian pipeline disaster, Chernobyl and Bhopal illustrate the potential risks. But the continuous scrutiny demanded and enforced by regulation of the high-risk cases and (for nuclear reactors) the designs of these installations are considerable forces on the side of safety. One day there will be a serious industrial accident; there are occasional near misses and worse; but it usually takes a good measure of folly, inattention and misfortune to overwhelm good  <head>plant</head>  and a safe system. Relatively few members of the public have been killed in Britain by industrial accidents in recent years. People expect risks they did not ask for and cannot control to be much lower -by 10 or 100 times  than those which they run willingly. People may smoke, drive at 80 miles an hour through fog on a motorway, go in for hang-gliding or rock climbing at the weekends. Yet they see nothing inconsistent with objecting to a well-engineered nuclear waste disposal plant which is clearly necessary to dispose safely of irradiated material already created; or to properly regulated high-combustion chemical waste disposal plants that are the only alternative (unless we get rid of the chemical industry) to toxic wastes being dumped surreptitiously in some field or on some beach.

Michael Harrison, our Industrial Editor, contrasts its performance with that of its foreign counterparts By MICHAEL HARRISON, Industrial Editor FORD'S ageing and ramshackle Dagenham site in Essex, once the jewel in the company's overseas operations, enters the 1990s with its very survival uncertain. The  <head>plant</head>  now dubiously boasts the poorest levels of productivity, quality and working conditions of any Ford factory in Europe. Unless it can effect a remarkable recovery, the factory may well disappear back into the bleak and sodden marshes of Essex from which it emerged nearly 60 years ago. The evidence of Dagenham's predicament can be gauged from internal company documents which illustrate graphically the task confronting Ford and its workforce. These show that it takes Dagenham nearly twice as long to produce a Sierra car as it does Ford's Genk plant in Belgium. The picture is similar when Fiesta production is compared at Dagenham and Valencia. The British plant takes 53 hours to turn out each car, the Spanish factory 30 hours. Product quality at the Essex factory is also inferior, measured against any index, whether it be ratings out of 10, defects per vehicle or warranty costs on each car leaving the factory gate. The Dagenham workforce would argue that there are good reasons why the ageing plant cannot match the performance of its modern Continental rivals. However, the documents also show that Dagenham's car body and assembly operations are failing to meet even its own internal targets. In 1988 the plant was scheduled to produce 992 cars a day.
