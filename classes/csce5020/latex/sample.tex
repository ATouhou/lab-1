I am currently a PhD student in the United States looking for employment in Oslo. For the next year I will spend my spare time working on my dissertation, but I want to establish a career in a company that I believe in.

My current research is in compilers, but I would like to develop my programming skills beyond theoretical topics and work within large group projects. Browsers are instrumental to the way we are using computers today, and that is why I am looking for employment with Opera.

Thank you,

Cameron Palmer
